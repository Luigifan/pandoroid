Pandoroid Radio
===============

This is eventually going to be a full-featured [Pandora Radio](http://www.pandora.com/) client for Android-based devices.  Due to failings in the proprietary application provided by Pandora Radio themselves, this application is being designed with three focuses in mind: _stability_, intuitiveness, and _configurability_ (in that order). At this stage, those are more "goals" then an actual reality.

I work on this project in my spare time with [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/) but push it to here for the added visibility.  Check out the project's home page (http://aregner.com/android/pandoroid/) for full details and its current status.

At the moment, the application is just about completely functional, with a few manageable bugs.  It is however not complete enough based on where I want to go with it nor properly tested.  Feedback is welcome and encouraged.
